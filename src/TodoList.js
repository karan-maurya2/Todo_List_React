// How to Get Individual Props with Destructuring:-
// Note that one additional shorthand is that instead of
//  referencing the entire object within the TodoList,
//   we can reference the individual properties on that
//    object to make our code a little bit shorter by using object destructuring.


    // Object destructuring :-
    
    // it is not a React concept,
    //  but a standard JavaScript feature that makes
    //   accessing object properties easier by immediately
    //    declaring them as individual variables.

//     What is object Destructuring in JavaScript?
// JavaScript Object Destructuring is an expression which allows
//  us to access the data from objects like arrays, objects,
//   maps and assign it to new variables. Through this object 
//   destructuring, we can create variables easily from the object's properties

// let { property1: variable1, property2: variable2 } = object;

// Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

// The identifier before the colon (:) is the property of the object and the identifier after the colon is the variable.

// Notice that the property name is always on the left whether itâ€™s an object literal or object destructuring syntax.

// If the variables have the same names as the properties of the object, you can make the code more concise as follows:

// let { firstName, lastName } = person;
